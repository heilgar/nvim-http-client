### Code Improvements
- Refactored command structure for better organization:
  - Split commands into separate files: `request.lua`, `select_env.lua`
  - Created a new `commands/init.lua` to manage command modules
- Updated `init.lua` to use the new command structure

## [1.0.0] - 2024-09-13
### New Features
- Added support for private environment files (.private.env.json)
  - Private environment files are now automatically detected and loaded
  - Private environments take precedence over public environments
- Implemented HTTP version support
  - Added ability to specify HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 in requests
  - HTTP/2 (Prior Knowledge) support added for servers that can handle HTTP/2 connections without upgrades
- Introduced SSL configuration options
  - Added ability to disable certificate verification for development environments
### Changes
- Updated environment handling mechanism
  - Improved merging of public and private environments
  - Default environments are now applied before specific environments
  - Private default environments override public default environments
- Modified HTTP request parsing to handle requests with and without explicit HTTP versions
### File Handling
- Modified file selection process to exclude private environment files from the overview
- Private environment file names now match their public counterparts
  - Example: .env.json -> .private.env.json
  - Example: http-client.env.json -> http-client.private.env.json
### Code Improvements
- Refactored environment.lua for better handling of public and private environment files
- Updated set_env_file function to set both current_env_file and current_private_env_file
- Modified set_env function to properly merge environments from both public and private files
- Added get_current_private_env_file function to retrieve the current private environment file path
- Refactored parser.lua to correctly handle HTTP version in request parsing
- Updated http_client.lua to support different HTTP versions and SSL configurations
### Code Restructuring
- Reorganized project structure for improved maintainability
  - Created `core` directory for main plugin logic
    - Moved `parser.lua`, `http_client.lua`, and `environment.lua` into `core`
  - Created `utils` directory for utility functions
    - Moved `file_utils.lua` and `verbose.lua` into `utils`
  - Created `ui` directory for user interface related code
    - Renamed `ui.lua` to `display.lua` and moved it to `ui`
    - Moved `dry_run.lua` into `ui`
  - Created new `config.lua` file for centralized configuration management
- Updated import statements across the project to reflect new file structure
- Improved modularity and logical grouping of related functionalities
### Security
- Improved handling of sensitive information by separating it into private environment files
- Private environment files are automatically excluded from git tracking (ensure .gitignore is updated)
- Added option to disable SSL certificate verification for trusted development environments
### User Interface
- Updated Telescope integration to show merged environment preview (public + private)
- Added dry run support for HTTP version display
### Documentation
- Updated documentation to include information on HTTP version support and SSL configuration options
### Note to Users
- Ensure your .gitignore includes *.private.env.json to prevent accidental commits of sensitive data
- To use private environments, create a .private.env.json file alongside your existing .env.json file
- When using self-signed certificates in development, you can now disable certificate verification in your environment configuration
